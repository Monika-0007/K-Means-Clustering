## 🌐 K-Means Clustering

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using Python. The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess data, apply clustering, and visualize results — showing how K-Means can be used in unsupervised learning.

# ✨ Features

✔️ K-Means clustering (from scratch & scikit-learn)

✔️ Data preprocessing & normalization

✔️ Cluster visualization with 2D/3D plots

✔️ Evaluation using Inertia & Silhouette Score

# 📊 Example Output

🔹 Clustered data points visualized in 2D/3D plots

🔹 Metrics showing the optimal number of clusters


# 🚀 Applications

K-Means is widely used in:

👥 Customer segmentation

🖼️ Image compression

🔍 Pattern recognition

🛒 Market basket analysis
